template 3,"A good example of this might be a speaking engagement. The goal is to promote/amplify the presenter's appearance and capture their key takeaways or repurpose as content on the website. However, it can be challenging to get details ahead of time, and even more challenging to capture their talking points. My hope is that a motion graphic like this will spur some action!

template 4,"Swarms are a crucial part of fostering strong inter-office relationships and enhancing team cohesion across geographic boundaries. These two-day events are designed to build trust, promote a sense of belonging, and provide a platform for team members to connect and collaborate on various levels. Often we have photos (both professional and attendee generated) that we use to promote and recap these events. 
Coming-up is the Mechanical and Electrical Swarm. They will swarm in Madison, WI and bring back attendee generated photos of their time together. On the agenda are opportunities to tour the Wisconsin State Capitol Building and the Overture Center; A larger group dinner and team trivia; Internal Presentations and breakout discussions; Keynote presentation.

The idea here would be to either provide the hiring manager or the new hire themselves with an asset they can share and celebrate  the team. I'm wondering if this one could be text and graphics only?
